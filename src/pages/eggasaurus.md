A JavaScript SPA clicker game built for my favorite dino expert -- my toddler. Park Rangers can hatch, name and play with their very own dinosaurs. When playing with a dino, users can click the mood buttons to feed and play with their pet, or send him for a nap. Leave him unattended too long and his mood levels will all deplete.
